      o sample_sntp: Retrieve NTP(Network Time Protocol) data
      o sample_w5500_eth
       - Change the default address mode to 3 address
       - Incorrect peer MAC address copy at 4-address enabled W5500 device
      o sample_wifi_relay : Runs softap and sta for relay operation
      o sample_vendor_ie : Receive vendor IE from beacon
    * Update AUXADC compensation
    * Duty cycle 2.8% support only for EU STA
    * Check traveling pilot support field of S1G capabilities element
    * Set the default listen interval to 0 for wifi_config
    * 1/2MHz STA support at 4MHz SoftAP
    * Add auto guard interval control
    * Add auto RX gain control
    * SoftAP's disable/enable sequence support
    * Add API for setting max station number in SoftAP
    * Hidden SSID support in SoftAP
    * Support for floating-point values in the ping interval of the ping operation
    * Add serial flash support: FM25W32A/GD25LQ16C/GD25WQ128E/W25Q16FW/XT25Q08B
    * Set country code from RF CAL data (AT-CMD)
    * Update Firwmare Flash Tool v6.3.0 (Multi v7.2.0)
      o Dynamic XIP boot erase size + max size check    
    
    Bugfix
    * Prevent manipulating source MAC address when 4 address is used for W5500 sample
    * TX power setting failure when changing from FIXED mode to AUTO mode (AT-CMD)
    * TX power in LIMIT mode not limited to the set value (AT-CMD)
    * Fix the recovery of the listen interval setting upon waking from deep sleep
    * Remove echo check code from lwip
    * TCP client socket was closed when enabling TCP keep-alive
    * Invalid secondary CCA on JP 2/4MHz channels
    * NDP CTS compliance for RTS with response indication (RI) 1 on AP
    * Set an invalid AID in the AID response element when sending an association response
    * AT-CMD lwIP keepalive issue: TCP client socket would close when TCP keep-alive was enabled
    * Handling exceptions for the invalid temperature value of 0
    * Invalid AID issue when forwarding a frame in the SoftAP
    * Delayed reconnection issue for the STA without deauthentication
    * Failure in setting the limit type for 'nrc_wifi_set_tx_power'
    * PN order mismatch during the packet retransmission

    Known Issues
    * The issue of deauthentication frame delivery failure can occur between PMF-enabled NRC7394 and PMF-enabled NRC7292 devices.
    * During deep sleep, TCP connections are not maintained. Upon waking up, a new TCP connection must be established.
    * The AT-CMD throughput over HSPI interface is slightly lower than NRC7292 device due to CPU clock speed variation.

Change summary for version 1.1:

    New features
    * AT-CMD feature: continuous TX operation (AT+WCTX)

    Changes
    * Enhanced RSSI accuracy of system_api_get_rssi()

    Bugfix
    * Intermittent scan failure on TW channel
    * AP's association grant for STA with listen interval exceeding BSS max idle period
    * CCA type of JP 2/4MHz channels
    * Inability to return to doze state in deep sleep mode for STA with static IP address
    * Scan failure on K2 channel
    * Incorrect peer MAC address copy at 4-address enabled W5500 device

    Known Issues
    * The initial connection time for WPA3-SAE/OWE can be quite lengthy (> 15 seconds) due to the substantial computational load required by software for large number operations.
    * The SoftAP disable/enable sequence on the standalone mode is not supported.
    * The issue of deauthentication frame delivery failure can occur between PMF-enabled NRC7394 and PMF-enabled NRC7292 devices.
    * During deep sleep, TCP connections are not maintained. Upon waking up, a new TCP connection must be established.
    * The AT-CMD throughput over HSPI interface is slightly lower than NRC7292 device due to CPU clock speed variation.
