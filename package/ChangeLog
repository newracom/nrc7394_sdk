    Bugfix
    * Prevent manipulating source MAC address when 4 address is used for W5500 sample
    * TX power setting failure when changing from FIXED mode to AUTO mode (AT-CMD)
    * TX power in LIMIT mode not limited to the set value (AT-CMD)
    * Fix the recovery of the listen interval setting upon waking from deep sleep
    * Remove echo check code from lwip
    * TCP client socket was closed when enabling TCP keep-alive
    * Invalid secondary CCA on JP 2/4MHz channels
    * NDP CTS compliance for RTS with response indication (RI) 1 on AP
    * Set an invalid AID in the AID response element when sending an association response
    * AT-CMD lwIP keepalive issue: TCP client socket would close when TCP keep-alive was enabled
